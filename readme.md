# Create Immersive Aircraft

Simple KubeJS scripts that modify _Immersive Aircraft_ recipes to use _Create_ items where applicable.

Currently for Minecraft 1.19.2+ only.

## Details

Both mods add Propeller and Sail items. _Create_'s variants are slightly harder to craft and more attractive, which is fitting for _Immersive Aircraft_. So, this mod simply removes recipes for _Immersive Aircraft_'s Propeller and Sail, hides them in JEI, then replaces those ingredients with _Create_'s Propeller and White Sail in all recipes.

## Installation

With _Create_, _Immersive Aircraft_, and _KubeJS_ installed in Minecraft 1.19.2+, just copy the scripts from `kubejs/client_scripts` and `kubejs/server_scripts` to the same locations in your minecraft folder. JEI is optional.

## Known Issues

Unfortunately the removed items cannot be hidden from the creative menu at this time due to limitations of KubeJS.
